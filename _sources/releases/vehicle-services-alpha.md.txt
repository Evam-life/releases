## 7.0.9 RC3

2026-01-08

### Highlights

* **Improved the Map performance:** The loading of Map assets was optimized, in particular the assets sent by Certified apps. This should improve the performance of the Map, notably when using Certified apps that leverage the Evam SDK Map functions such as Incident Command.

## 7.0.9 RC2

2026-01-02

### Highlights

* **Fixed an issue where TETRA status could be sent twice:** In previous versions, sending a TETRA status from a Receiver device when running Multiple Screens could cause it to be sent twice over the network. This should now be fixed.

## 7.0.9 RC1

2025-12-19

### Highlights

* **Vehicle Status sent notification shows for a shorter amount of time:** Previously, the notification indicating a status was automatically sent displayed for 10s. This has been reduced to 3s based on your feedback, with the goal of de-cluttering the screen.

### Additional changes

* **Fixed an issue with the display of the connection status in Multiple Screens:** Previous versions had a bug when using Multiple Screens that caused the display of the number of connected receivers in the top bar to be incorrect if the device was running Android 15 and above, this should now be fixed.
* **Updated the TETRA Radio widget in the Operations app:** When no talk group is selected, the Radio widget will show "No Talk group" instead of having the entire widget being hidden.

## 7.0.8 RC1

2025-12-12

### Highlights

* **Fixed an issue with the Status sending timestamp in the Status Tab:** Customers using Vehicle Services with GD92 integration could experience erroneous timestamps in the Status Tab, where the timestamp would sometimes show the current time instead of the actual sending time of the status. This is now resolved. 
* **Fixed an issue where Vehicle Services would fail to reconnect to Central Services under some circumstances:** An issue was previously present that could lead Vehicle Services to lose connection to Central Services and not be able to recover, potentially leading to missed messages and mobilisations. This could notably happen if Vehicle Services was restarted automatically after a system component update. We have now fixed this issue and Vehicle Services should remain connected provided an internet connection is available.


## 7.0.7 RC2

2025-12-11

### Highlights

* **Fixed a bug with the status update upon incident confirmation:** A bug was found in the previous version, when confirming a new incident by pressing the confirm button the associated status to the control room will not be sent if the user is using the automatic statuses function. This is now fixed so the status will be sent as it should upon confirming the incident.


## 7.0.6 RC2

2025-11-05

### Highlights

* **Fixed Fake location provider issue:** Fixed a bug introduced with 7.0.6 RC1 where the Fake location provider no longer updated the position upon request.
* **Fixed issues with Automatic Statuses:** Fixed bugs with the automatic statuses which could behave in unexpected ways in some occasions.

## 7.0.6 RC1

2025-10-30

### Highlights

* **Vehicle Statuses can now be sent automatically:** A major new feature was added to the Vehicle Statuses, allowing them to be configured to be automatically sent when specific conditions are met (such as arriving at incident site, exiting the home station, and more). When the conditions are met, a notification will show in Vehicle Services with a countdown which - upon completion - will cause the status to be automatically sent. The end user can cancel the countdown, as well as send the status immediately if needed. This functionality is opt-in, so make sure to reach out to Evam support to enable it if you want to use it.
* **Major update to the navigation engine:** A significant overhaul of the Navigation App core engine was deployed, it improves the vehicle positioning as well as the routing experience significantly. The overall look and feel of the Navigation App does not change, but the general experience should now be improved with smoother routing and the occasional erratic positioning issues should now be less frequent.

### Additional changes

* **Vehicle Services now displays the time and date of the last status sending:** In the Status Tab under the Operations App, Vehicle Services will now display when the current Vehicle Status was sent.
