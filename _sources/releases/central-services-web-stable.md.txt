### Highlights

* **Improved the Chat app stability:** The Chat App was rewritten to be more robust and handle better loss of connection.

### Additional changes

* **Added text showing when there are no incidents in the Incident Command app:** You will now see a text saying "No incident available" when there is none in the Incident Command app.
* **Fixed issue with message display:** Fixed an issue where the Chat App would display messages with new lines as a long single line instead, which made them harder to read
